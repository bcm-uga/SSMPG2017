             Dynamic Creator of Mersenne Twisters Ver. 0.6 (2009/12/15)

1. Overview
   This is a C library for "Dynamic Creator", which dynamically
  generates a parameter for a random number generator. Users
  can specify (1) the word size w of generated random integers
  (presently w=31,32 only) (2) the period (chosen from the
  list of Mersenne primes below), and (3) id-number.

   When these specifications are given to a function in this
  library, it searches for a set of parameters (stored in
  a struct type named mt_struct) of a recursion generating
  a random number sequence conforming to the specification.
  If we specify different id-numbers, then the set of yielded
  random number sequences should be highly independent.

   Each random number generator is a Mersenne Twister with
  specified size, which is very widely used and is proved to
  be a reliable source of pseudorandomness.

2. Compiling

   When you develop the tar file, you will find the following
  three files and three directories.

    README              This file
    README.jp             Japanese version of the above file
    VERSION               Version information
    CHANGELOG             Log of changes
    lib                   The library
    include               The include file "dc.h"
    example               Examples of C-codes

    To compile this library,  do "cd lib" and "make lib".
  Then "libdcmt.a" will be created in the directory "lib",
  and the compilation for the library is done.

    To use the library, include "dc.h" in the include directory
  in your C-code source files, and link them with libdcmt.a
  when you compile the source.

3. The library functions
  ===============
  OLD INTERFACE
  ===============
  Old interface functions are not thread safe.
  Interface is same as old version, but we do not assure the
  results of the functions are the same as the results of old versions.

   void init_dc(uint32 seed)
      Initializes this library, i.e., initialize the internal
     random number generator of this library. One needs to call
     this function once, before using any of get_mt_parameter(),
     get_mt_parameter_id(), get_mt_parameters().
     The seed may be any integer between 0 and 2^32-1, so
     2^32 possible choices.

       If this function is called with one same seed, then the
     generated parameters are identical for any system, i.e.,
     it is reproducible.

     NOTE: This function is not used in new interface.


   mt_struct *get_mt_parameter(int w, int p)
       Search for a set of parameters for random number generator.
     (We call such a parameter a "mt_struct parameter".) w is the
     number of bits in one word of generated random numbers
     (w=31 or 32 only). p is the exponent of the period. The period
     should be 2^p-1, but p must be an Mersenne exponent, i.e.,
     2^p-1 should be a prime. The list of usable p are as follows.
       521   607  1279  2203
       2281  3217  4253  4423
       9689  9941 11213 19937
       21701 23209 44497

       This function returns a mt_struct parameter, when it
     finds one, and returns NULL, when it failed to find.
     The function genrand_mt() below will generate a random
     number sequence of w-bit integers with period 2^p-1,
     when this mt_struct parameter is passed.

       Depending on the machine's speed, it may take one minute
     or more in finding one mt_struct parameter even if p=521.
     The average time in the search is rapidly increasing
     with respect to p. For large p, it is expected to be
     O(p^3).

   mt_struct *get_mt_parameter_id(int w, int p, int id)
       This is similar to the above get_mt_parameter().
     get_mt_parameter() admits only w and p, but this function
     takes one more parameter, called id, and generates a
     mt_struct parameter, in which id is embedded.
       id is an 16-bit integer. For different id's, the
     generated random number sequences are highly independent.
     (Mathematically saying, the characteristic polynomials
     of the recursion are coprime to each other.)

  mt_struct **get_mt_parameters(int w, int p, int max_id, int *count)
       This searches for a set of mt_struct parameters with
     id between start_id and max_id (start_id<=id<=max_id). Thus, it finds
     (max_id-start_id)+1 independent mt_struct parameters, and make them
     into an array, and return it. The maximum value of max_id
     is 2^16-1.
       This returns 'count', which is normally max_id - start_id + 1.
     If some parameters are found and then error occurs or cannot
     found new parameter, count will less than max_id - start_id + 1.
       Users should call free_mt_struct_array after using structs, unless
     This function returns NULL.

  ===============
  NEW INTERFACE
  ===============
  'init_dc' function is not used in new interface.
  Instead, each function needs additional argument 'seed'.
  New interface functions are so-called thread safe or thread independent.

  mt_struct *get_mt_parameter_st(int w, int p, uint32_t seed)
  Thread safe version of 'get_mt_parameter'.

  mt_struct *get_mt_parameter_id_st(int w, int p, int id, uint32_t seed)
  Thread safe version of 'get_mt_parameter_id'.

  mt_struct **get_mt_parameters_st(int w, int p, int start_id, int max_id, uint32_t seed, int *count)
  Thread safe version of 'get_mt_parameters'.

  ===============
  COMMON INTERFACE
  ===============
  Following functions are used commonly in old interface and new interface.

  void sgenrand_mt(uint32_t seed, mt_struct *mts)
       One mt_struct parameter has the information on the recursion
     and the state vector. This function initializes this state vector
     in mts with the seed. Before using the random numbers on the
     mt_struct parameter mts, call this function once to initialize.
     The seed is any integer between 0 and 2^32-1, and each seed
     generates distinct sequences.

  uint32_t genrand_mt(mt_struct *mts)
       This returns a random number, generated from mts,
     by using the recursion specified in the mts, and the state vector
     inside mts.

  void free_mt_struct(mt_struct *mts);
   Free memories allocated by get_mt_parameter,
   get_mt_parameter_id,get_mt_parameter_st or get_mt_parameter_id_st.

  void free_mt_struct_array(mt_struct **mtss, int count);
   Free memories allocated by get_mt_parameters or get_mt_parameters_st.

4. Examples

4.1 example1
   Move to the directory "example", and execute "make example1".
  Then an executable file "example1" will be created.

   Execute "example1", and wait for one minute. Then
  get_mt_parameter(32,521) will give a mt_struct parameter
      period 2^521-1. (If it could not find one, then print
  "error".)

   This mt_struct parameter is stored in mts. Using this,
  by genrand_mt(mts), 100 random numbers will be generated
  and printed.

4.2 example2
   Similarly to 4.1, in the directory example, execute
  "make example2" and obtain an executable file "example2".
  Execute "example2", and wait for five minutes. Then
  three mt_struct parameters of 32-bit and period 2^521-1.
  Each has id 0,1,999.

   Store these three mt_struct parameters in mts0, mts1, mts2.
  Using these, genrand_mt() generates three highly independent
  three random number sequnces. First tens of each sequence
  will be printed.

5. Caution
   This library was developed on Vine Linux 2.6R4.
  It is expected to work in most of 32-bit machines with
  a C99 compiler.

   This library is still under development, and may contain
  some serious bugs. Please keep this in your mind. Report
  the bugs to the authors, if you find any.
